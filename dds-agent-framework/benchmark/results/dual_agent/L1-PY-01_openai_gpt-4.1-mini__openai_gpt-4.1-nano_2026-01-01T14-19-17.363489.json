Fix any errors or test failures one by one in small iterations.\n\n6. **Make sure** naming, domain ID, sample values and timing match the requirement exactly.\n\nKeep your code well structured in a single file named `publisher.py`. The test environment expects a complete, runnable script that exits cleanly after publishing.\n\nOnce you write your first version, run the test and provide me any error messages or test failures so I can help troubleshoot.\n\nYour first step: implement the `create_hello_world_type()` function, create the participant with domain 85, the topic named \"HelloWorld\", and set up the publisher and dynamic data writer. Confirm you can get that far without errors before you add publishing logic.\n\nRemember: test early and frequently to catch mistakes early!"
