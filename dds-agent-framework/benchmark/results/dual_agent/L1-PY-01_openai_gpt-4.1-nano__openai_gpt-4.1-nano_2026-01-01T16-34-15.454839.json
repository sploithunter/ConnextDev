      "content": "Great, you're close to completing the publisher. Here's how I want you to approach this:\n\n1. **Start with the type definition**:\n   - Use `dds.StructType` named `\"HelloWorld\"` with two members:\n     - `message` as `dds.StringType(256)`\n     - `count` as `dds.Int32Type()`\n   - Generate this type first and verify it works before proceeding.\n\n2. **Create the main function**:\n   - Instantiate the `DomainParticipant` with domain ID 85 (very important to keep this fixed).\n   - Create a `Topic` named `\"HelloWorld\"` associated with your type, using `dds.DynamicData.Topic`.\n   - Create a `Publisher` and then a `DataWriter` linked to the topic, again using the `dds.DynamicData` pattern.\n\n3. **Build the publishing loop**:\n   - Wait 2 seconds after startup for discovery (`time.sleep(2)`).\n   - Loop from 1 to 10:\n     - Create a `DynamicData` sample with your type.\n     - Assign `message` as `\"Hello World {n}\"` and `count` as `n`.\n     - Write the sample and sleep 0.5 seconds between each.\n\n4. **Finally**, wait one more second after publishing all samples for delivery.\n\nRemember:\n- Use `rti.connextdds` API as shown.\n- Do **not** use any deprecated or incorrect classes like `dds.Topic` or `dds.DataWriter`.\n- Run the code after each change to verify behavior.\n\nOnce you have this skeleton running and publishing, verify with `dds-spy-wrapper` to ensure data is visible. Only then will the tests give you passing results.\n\nStart with the type definition and the overall structure, and show me how it goes!"
