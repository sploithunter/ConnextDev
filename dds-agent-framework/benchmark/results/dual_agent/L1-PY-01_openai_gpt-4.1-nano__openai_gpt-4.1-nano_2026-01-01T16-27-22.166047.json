      "content": "Great, you have a clear goal. Here's your initial plan:\n\n1. **Start with importing `rti.connextdds` and defining the type creation function.**  \n   Confirm that the type is correctly specified with `message` (string(256)) and `count` (int32).  \n   \n2. **Create the `DomainParticipant` with domain ID 85.**  \n   Remember, do not hardcode other domain IDs; keep it fixed at 85.\n\n3. **Create the topic using `dds.DynamicData.Topic`.  \n  ** Use the exact name \"HelloWorld\". \n\n4. **Create a Publisher and DataWriter using `dds.DynamicData.DataWriter`.**  \n   Follow the pattern to avoid using plain `dds.Topic` or `dds.DataWriter`.\n\n5. **Add a short wait (2 seconds) to ensure discovery is complete.**  \n   Before publishing, so the system properly discovers the other DDS entities.\n\n6. **Implement a loop to publish exactly 10 samples, with a 0.5-second delay between each.**  \n   Set `message` as `\"Hello World {n}\"` and `count` as `n`.\n\n7. **After the loop, wait 1 second** to allow final delivery.\n\n**Next step:**  \nWrite the minimal code to create the type and publish one sample with the correct pattern. Run your test to see if it publishes.  \nOnce that works, expand to the full loop.\n\n**Remember:**  \n- Focus on correctness first, then timing.  \n- Use the pattern with `dds.DynamicData.Topic` and `dds.DynamicData.DataWriter`.  \n- Run after each change to catch errors early.\n\nProceed with that approach, and let me see your initial results."
