Add two files to the project root with the exact contents shown in that solution section:\n   - inbound_adapter.py\n   - outbound_adapter.py\n\nAfter creating them, run the test harness and the manual test. First run:\n- python test_bridge.py\n\nIf that isn't available or you want to run the manual end-to-end test, run the sequence from the task description:\n1. Generate test data:\n   - python -c \"from protocol import *; open('test.bin','wb').write(b''.join(encode_message(m) for m in generate_test_messages(10)))\"\n2. Start the outbound (subscriber) in background:\n   - python outbound_adapter.py --output received.bin --count 10 --timeout 30 &\n3. Run the inbound (publisher):\n   - python inbound_adapter.py --input test.bin\n4. Compare:\n   - diff test.bin received.bin && echo \"SUCCESS!\"\n\nBefore running, ensure:\n- protocol.py is in the same directory\n- rti.connextdds (Connext Python) is installed and available to Python\n- Files are executable or run via python <file>.py\n\nReport back with the test output or any errors (copy the exact trace). I will review and give the next specific change if needed."
