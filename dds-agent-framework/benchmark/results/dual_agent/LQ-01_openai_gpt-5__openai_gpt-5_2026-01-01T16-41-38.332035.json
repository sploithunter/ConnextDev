The subscriber likely has the same broken QoS.\n\nNext step (make these exact changes, then run python test_durability.py):\n\n1) Update publisher.py QoS\n- Replace the broken QoS with TRANSIENT_LOCAL + RELIABLE and keep all history. Also keep the writer alive a bit longer so late joiners can receive the cached data before the writer is destroyed.\n\nExact edits:\n- Replace:\n  writer_qos.durability.kind = dds.DurabilityKind.VOLATILE\n  writer_qos.reliability.kind = dds.ReliabilityKind.BEST_EFFORT\n- With:\n  writer_qos.durability.kind = dds.DurabilityKind.TRANSIENT_LOCAL\n  writer_qos.reliability.kind = dds.ReliabilityKind.RELIABLE\n  writer_qos.history.kind = dds.HistoryKind.KEEP_ALL\n\n- Replace the final sleep:\n  time.sleep(0.5)\n- With:\n  time.sleep(3.0)\n\n2) Update subscriber.py QoS\n- Make the reader QoS match the writer:\n\nReplace:\n  rea",
