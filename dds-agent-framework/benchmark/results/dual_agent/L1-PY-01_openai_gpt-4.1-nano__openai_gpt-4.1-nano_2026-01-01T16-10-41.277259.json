      "content": "Great, let's approach this systematically.\n\n1. **Start by setting up the type definition**: Create a function to define your `HelloWorld` structure with `message` (string, max 256) and `count` (int32). Make sure this part is correct first.\n\n2. **Create the main setup**: Instantiate the `DomainParticipant` with domain ID 85, and ensure the topic \"HelloWorld\" is created with your custom type.\n\n3. **Create the publisher and data writer**: Use `dds.Publisher` and `dds.DynamicData.DataWriter` as specified.\n\n4. **Implement the publishing loop**: Publish 10 samples, with `message` like `\"Hello World {n}\"` and `count=n`. Add delays of 0.5 seconds between each sample.\n\n5. **Add initial waits**: Wait 2 seconds before publishing for discovery, and 1 second at the end for delivery.\n\n**Your first step**: Write just the type definition and creation code, and verify that your publisher runs without errors up to that point. Then proceed to create the topic and publisher.\n\nRemember:\n- Use only the `rti.connextdds` API with `DynamicData`.\n- Test after each step to ensure correctness.\n- Don't try to do everything at once; build iteratively.\n\nOnce the type setup works, add the main logic and publishing loop. This approach will help isolate issues early.\n\nStart with that, and run your tests. Let me know when you've completed the type creation step successfully or if you encounter any errors!"
