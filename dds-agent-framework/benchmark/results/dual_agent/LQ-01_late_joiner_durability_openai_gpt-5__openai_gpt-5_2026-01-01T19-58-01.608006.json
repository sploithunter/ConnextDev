With BEST_EFFORT, samples can be dropped even when both sides are up.\n- When the publisher starts first, it finishes sending and exits quickly. Even if we switch to TRANSIENT_LOCAL durability, the DataWriter must still be alive for late joiners to receive cached samples.\n\nNext step (one change set, then re-run tests):\n1) Update BOTH publisher.py and subscriber.py QoS to use durability TRANSIENT_LOCAL, reliability RELIABLE, and history KEEP_ALL.\n\nIn publisher.py, replace:\n- writer_qos.durability.kind = dds.DurabilityKind.VOLATILE\n- writer_qos.reliability.kind = dds.ReliabilityKind.BEST_EFFORT\nwith:\n- writer_qos.durability.kind = dds.DurabilityKind.TRANSIENT_LOCAL\n- writer_qos.reliability.kind = dds.ReliabilityKind.RELIABLE\n- writer_qos.history.kind = dds.HistoryKind.KEEP_ALL\n\nIn subscriber.py, replace:\n- reader_qos.durability.kind ",
