In publisher.py, change the QoS settings:\n   \u2022 Replace the line that sets writer_qos.durability.kind from VOLATILE to TRANSIENT_LOCAL.\n   \u2022 Replace the line that sets writer_qos.reliability.kind from BEST_EFFORT to RELIABLE.\n   \u2022 Set writer_qos.history.kind to KEEP_ALL.\n   \u2022 Increase the final sleep duration from 0.5 seconds to around 3.0 seconds to allow the subscriber extra time to receive cached samples.\n\n2. In subscriber.py, similarly change the QoS settings:\n   \u2022 Replace the line that sets reader_qos.durability.kind from VOLATILE to TRANSIENT_LOCAL.\n   \u2022 Replace the line that sets reader_qos.reliability.kind from BEST_EFFORT to RELIABLE.\n   \u2022 Set reader_qos.history.kind to KEEP_ALL.\n\n3. After making these changes in both files, run the provided test_durability.py script. The test should simulate random startup orders. It must receive all 10/10 samples in every run.\n\n4. Test early after each change to ensure you\u2019re making progress.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done these modifications, run the tests and report back on the results.\n\nLet\u2019s start with making these changes in publisher.py and subscriber.py according to the above instructions, then test again."
