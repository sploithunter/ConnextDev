      "content": "Welcome to the RTI DDS Gen Workflow task! This is a step-by-step process where we'll convert from DynamicData to generated types.\n\n**Your first task is simple and focused:**\n\n## Step 1: Create the IDL file\n\nCreate a file named `HelloWorld.idl` with this exact content:\n\n```idl\n// HelloWorld.idl\nstruct HelloWorld {\n    string<256> message;\n    long count;\n};\n```\n\n**After creating the file:**\n1. Verify it exists: `ls -la HelloWorld.idl`\n2. Check the content: `cat HelloWorld.idl`\n3. Report back with the results\n\n**Important notes:**\n- The IDL syntax is strict - use exact spacing and semicolons\n- `string<256>` means a bounded string of max 256 characters\n- `long` maps to Python int (32-bit signed integer)\n\nThis is just the first step. We'll generate the Python code in the next step, but let's make sure the IDL file is correct first.\n\nWhat do you see when you create and verify the IDL file?"

HelloWorld.idl\n```\n\n**After running rtiddsgen:**\n1. Check what files were generated: `ls -la HelloWorld*`\n2. Verify the Python file can be imported: `python -c \"from HelloWorld import HelloWorld; print('Import successful')\"` \n3. Report back with the results\n\n**What to expect:**\n- rtiddsgen should generate `HelloWorld.py` (and possibly other support files)\n- The import test should print \"Import successful\"\n- If you get any errors, show me the exact error message\n\n**Common issues:**\n- If `$NDDSHOME` is not set, you'll get a \"command not found\" error\n- If rtiddsgen fails, check that your IDL syntax is correct\n\nRun the rtiddsgen command and let me know what happens!",
